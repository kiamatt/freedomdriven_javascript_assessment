//  Javascript Assessment
//---------------------------

// For each section, read the instructions and add your code to the code area.
// Wherever possible, use methods rather than global functions.
// We're looking for conciseness, intuition and adherence to best practices. Good luck!




//---------------------------
//  Section 1
//---------------------------


// Make an ajax call to openweathermap.org. Use their documentation to find out how to query their api.
// Use the appid 8690974851e3f54d7ce53bc8c6738558
// Make the API return a five day forecast for any city you'd like, with JSON as the mode and imperial as the units
// Set your city in your query to a variable in the same scope as your ajax method.




//---------------------------
//  Section 2
//---------------------------


// Bootstrap has been added to index.html for this assessment.
// For every day in your five day forecast, append a div with the class col-sm-4 to the existing row in index.html
// In each div, add a header tag including the "main" property in that day's forecast
// Next, include the day's icon in a responsive image. Refer to openweathermap's documentation to find out how to do this.
// Next, include the day's weather description.
// Finally, include the day's average temperature. The average temperature is not provided in the JSON response.




//---------------------------
//  Section 3
//---------------------------


// Add a dropdown somewhere on the page with a list of three cities. Allow a user to click on a city and get an updated forecast for that city.
// Update your method to allow users to choose between imperial and metric units.
// Use the provided ajax loader .gif during ajax calls.




//---------------------------
//  Section 4
//---------------------------


// Add a method to the String object called grammarize, which capitalizes the first letter in a string and adds a period to the end of the string if it doesn't have one already.
// Run grammarize on all of your weather descriptions with each new ajax call.
